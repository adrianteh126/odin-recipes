      <h2>Beefy Chinese Dumplings</h2>
      <p>
        This is a delicious meat and veggie dumpling recipe that my mom has been
        making ever since I can remember. It may take some time and practice
        when it comes to making these, but it's well worth it. Just boil them in
        water, and serve hot with soy sauce, or add them to a soup.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
        <li>1 carrot, shredded</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, mix together beef, cabbage, carrot, and onion. Stir
          in the egg, sugar, salt, soy sauce, and vegetable oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a large teaspoonful of filling in the center of a dumpling skin.
          Moisten the edges of a wonton with a few drops of water. Then fold the
          dumpling in half, and pinch the edges together to seal. Create a
          ripple pattern along the pinched edge by pinching and gently pushing
          together small segments of it. Repeat with remaining dumplings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil the dumplings in water until they float to the top, about 5
          minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
